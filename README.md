Bpl Player squad 

1. In the first session, I completed as much of the CSS design as I could, using Tailwind and DaisyUI.

2. I am now using ChatGPT and have added the necessary fake data for my project.

3. Then, I created a player section and placed the data there.

4. I have created a section where the players will appear once they are selected.

5. I have used all the necessary icons wherever they were needed.
